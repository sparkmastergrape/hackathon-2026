// Choosing a channel to demo on, deliberately.
//
// Both runners used to take `channels.find(c => c.channel_status === "open")` —
// the first open channel the service happened to list. With more than one open
// that is a coin toss, and we lost it: a channel with 0.024 RLUSD left was
// picked over one with 0.715, which would have stopped the demo after two calls
// with the cap doing exactly what it is supposed to do, at the worst moment.
//
// So: pick by on-chain headroom, not by list order, and refuse before the demo
// starts rather than halfway through it. A run that cannot finish should fail
// while there is still time to do something about it.
