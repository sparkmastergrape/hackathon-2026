Where this ends — the boundary, stated honestly:

  Injection into the agent's REASONING is contained. There is no phrasing of a
  document that widens the envelope, because the envelope is a signed struct and
  the verifier never reads prose.

  Compromise of the PROCESS holding the voucher key is NOT contained by the
  Mandate. In AP4M the agent's own software key signs vouchers, so code running
  as the agent can sign one the Guard never approved. What bounds that is the
  on-chain channel cap — which no signature can lift — and nothing else. That is
  why the cap is small, funded deliberately, and treated as the real loss limit.
  Revocation shortens the window; it does not close it.

  See docs/ARCHITECTURE.md §7 (T1, T2) and docs/DX-LOG.md.
