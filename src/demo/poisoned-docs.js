// The attacks, as a corpus.
//
// Each entry is a document an agent might fetch in the course of honest work —
// a datasheet, a changelog, a support reply — carrying text aimed at the agent
// rather than at a reader. These are the payloads, written the way real ones
// are written: authoritative tone, fake system framing, claimed pre-approval,
// urgency, and a plausible reason the rules should bend just this once.
//
// THE DEMO ASSUMES EVERY ONE OF THEM WORKS.
//
// That is the point. We do not model an agent that resists, spots the trick, or
// is "prompt-hardened": a demo where the agent is clever proves nothing, because
// the next model, the next phrasing or the next day's jailbreak takes it back.
// In every scene below the agent is fully compromised and does exactly what the
// attacker says. What refuses is the layer underneath, which is not a model, has
// no instructions to override, and reads only a struct a human signed on a
// device (ARCHITECTURE §7 T1, T2).
//
// `effect` is what the obedient agent then tries to do — the attacker's goal
// expressed as changes to the payment. `expect` is the Guard code that must
// come back. If a scene ever stops matching its `expect`, the suite fails:
// an attack that starts failing for a *different* reason is an attack we have
// stopped understanding.
