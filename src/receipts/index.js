// The receipt chain: for one payment, every link from the human's thumb to the
// transaction, with nothing taken on trust.
//
//   human signature -> Mandate -> Guard verdict -> reservation
//     -> voucher (cumulative) -> settlement tx -> channel state
//
// A chain is only worth showing if each link is CHECKED rather than asserted.
// So each link carries its own `verified` flag and says how it was established:
// a signature is verified by recovering it, a digest by recomputing it, a
// transaction by its receipt. Anything we have not checked says so.
//
// This is the "receipt chain view" of BUILD-PLAN Tier 2 item 8, and it is also
// the answer to the judging criterion about on-chain proof: the demo should not
// ask anyone to believe a log line.
